    <main>
        <p>This book is like a classy black-and-white movie. It keeps things simple and looks really nice with a touch of elegance. The writing is in a fancy serif font, and there's plenty of empty space around the words. When you open it, the left page is empty, and the content starts on the next one. The page numbers hang out at the bottom, and little flower designs pop up here and there to separate the big titles from the regular text. It's like a minimalist work of art in book form!</p>

        <h2>Gestalt Principles</h2>
        <p>The book has a very simple hierarchy going on. The typeface is the same and the font as well (pretty much). The designer used negative space and the little flower elements to create the hierarchy and separate the title from the body text.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I feel overall the book is very well designed. It is black and white which works very well with the typeface as well. The designer could have used a simple sans serif typeface for the body text or like a lighter serif. The font of the body text couldâ€™ve been smaller as well in my opinion. The use of flowers definitely acts as fun and playful elements which adds onto the overall design. It is very interesting to see how each chapter acts as a flower petal and attached itself to the center of the flower, and the flower gets complete as a composition at the end of the book.</p>
