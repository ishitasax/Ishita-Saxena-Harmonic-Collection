Hey there! I'm so excited to share my New York adventure with you. About a year and a half ago, I landed in the city as an international student, wide-eyed and ready for whatever this place had to offer. Now, through this website, I want to take you along on the rollercoaster of my experiences.

Think of each page like a different chapter in my New York story. It's a digital memoir capturing moments from my first days of exploration to the more personal discoveries that followed. Click around, and you'll get to know the layers of my evolving relationship with this incredible city.

This isn't just a story; it's an interactive journey, and I want you to see the city through my eyes. So, let's take a cyber stroll through my New York together. Every scroll is like taking a step, and every link opens up a new part of this city that never sleeps. Dive into the digital heartbeat of New York with me, where every click reveals a piece of my adventure. Join me, and let's explore the city together.
