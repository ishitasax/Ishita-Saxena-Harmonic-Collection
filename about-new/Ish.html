  <h1> About </h1>
  <div class="vertical-line"></div>

  <p>Embark with me on a profound digital journey through the corridors of my New York memoir, a testament to my evolution within this vibrant cityscape. Just 1.5 years ago, I, an international student, arrived on these storied streets, and through the pixels and prose of this website, I invite you to traverse the kaleidoscope of my experiences.

<br>This digital memoir is my invitation to you to share in the profound connection between a newcomer and a city that has become more than a geographical locationâ€”it's a canvas upon which dreams are woven, memories etched, and a future continually shaped. Welcome to the chapters of my New York, where every webpage is a portal into the intricate dance of my life within the city's embrace.</p>
